Summary 1
The core research focus of Sakana AI is applying nature-inspired ideas, 
such as evolution and collective intelligence, to create new foundation models. 
The company is developing technology that uses evolution to automate the development 
of foundation models with particular abilities suitable for user-specified 
application domains.

The company is developing technology that uses evolution to automate the development
of foundation models with specific abilities suitable for user-specified application
domains. As a first step, they released a report on Evolutionary Optimization of 
Model Merging Recipes, which introduces Evolutionary Model Merge, a general method 
that uses evolutionary techniques to efficiently discover the best ways to 
combine different models. They tested this approach by evolving a Japanese Large 
Language Model (LLM) capable of Math reasoning and a Japanese Vision-Language Model
 (VLM), achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

application domains. The team has released a report on their approach, 
Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes, which uses evolutionary 
techniques to efficiently discover the best ways to combine different models from 
the vast ocean of open-source models. They have successfully evolved two new 
foundation models for Japan: a Japanese Large Language Model (LLM) capable of
Math reasoning and a Japanese Vision-Language Model (VLM).
