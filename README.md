# LangChainTask
This is part of iCogLabs weekly intern training assignment. This one focuses on leveraging langchian package for various ends. The implementation here is a custom question-and-answer bot that shows the summary of a given webpage so that the user can have an overall idea and raise questions about which one needs more explanation on. Then the user is prompted to ask questions and the bot responds by referring to the contents of the webpage uploaded by the user. The bot responds wiht relevant contents and if content not available will notify the user of the situation.


## File Organization
Main folder --- langChainTask -- contains the main.py file, utils and files folders
Subfolders --- 
utils -- contains all the sub-routines called in by the main.py

__init__.py -- for imports

document_loading.py -- loads text from the web using user urls makes use of *WebBaseLoader* from *langchain_community.document_loaders*

summarization.py -- produces a four-sentence summary of the whole page using *load_summarize_chain* from *langchain.chains.summarize import* and the open source LLM agent *ChatGroq* and *PromptTemplate* all from langchain module

embedding.py -- makes use of text splitter and FAISS vector store to create index for similarity search later with the user query

files -- contains sample of chain run using *https://sakana.ai/evolutionary-model-merge/* and *https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rxe1wv9ero* in a .txt files

### Simplest application
of langchain included here as well as simplest_lang_chain.py
It surely cant get any simpler than this üòÅ!

### Warning
The embedder has size limitations about the number of tokens that can be handled. So take that into consideration. Apart from that and some deprecation warnings which couldnt go way despite all that I did, the system works well for custom chat based on the text from the web page.
Thanks!
